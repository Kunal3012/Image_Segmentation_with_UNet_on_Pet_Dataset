## Introduction

Image segmentation is a crucial computer vision task that involves dividing an image into segments, making it easier to analyze and interpret. The U-Net architecture is a popular choice for image segmentation due to its ability to capture fine details.

## Dataset

The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset consists of images of pets along with pixel-level segmentation masks. The dataset provides a diverse set of images for training and evaluating the segmentation model.

## Model Architecture

The U-Net model architecture used in this project comprises an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder captures contextual information, while the decoder reconstructs the segmented output. Convolutional layers and upsampling operations are employed to achieve this.

## Results

The model is trained for 10 epochs on the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, and the results are visualized for a sample image. The predictions demonstrate the ability of the model to accurately segment objects in the image.

## Usage
